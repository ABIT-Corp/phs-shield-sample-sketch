# phs-shield-sample-sketch
This repository is for sample Arduino sketches for Abit's PHS Shield.

These sketches depends on "a3gs" library for Arduino.
The "a3gs" library can be obtained from following website.

http://a3gs.wiki.fc2.com/

The "a3gs" library is a software library originally intended to be used with
"3G Shield" products sold by the Open Wirelss Alliance, and TABrain Inc.
Because PHS Shield is almost, if not fully, drop-in compatible with
3G Shield, PHS Shield can also be operated with "a3gs" library.
